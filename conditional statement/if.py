# conditional statements:
# if[condition]:
#     statements
# elif[conditions]:
#     statements
# else:
#     statements

# example:
num1=100
num2= 200
# 1> num1 is greater,2> num2 is greater,3>num1 and num2 are equal
# if(num1>num2):
#     print("Num1 is greater than num2")
# elif(num2>num1):
#     print("Num2 is greater than num1")
# else:
#     print("both are equal")

# indention: every python block has indentation if we don't give that it will give error
if 1:

# if we give any non zero value after if it will consider as true go to  if block but if we give 0 it will go to the else block
